The bacterial order Pelagibacterales (SAR11) is abundant and widely distributed across the global surface ocean, where its activities are integral to the marine carbon cycle. High-quality genomes from cell isolates that can be propagated and phenotyped are needed to unify perspectives on the ecology and evolutionary history of this critical and complex group of closely related cell types. Here, we increase the number of complete SAR11 isolate genomes threefold by describing 81 new SAR11 strains from seven distinct lineages isolated from coastal and offshore surface seawater of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Comprehensive comparative analyses of genomes and spatiotemporal distributions in the local and global oceans support 24 monophyletic, discrete Pelagibacterales ecotypes that we define as genera. Spatiotemporal patterns in the distributions of the genera were correlated at fine scales with variation in ecologically-relevant gene content, supporting generic assignments and providing further indications of speciation within the genera. We propose that complex environmental SAR11 populations can be cast into a hierarchical system of classification that is meaningfully correlated with evolution and ecology, providing a valid and utilitarian systematic nomenclature for this clade.
